🌟 About This Project

my dev Portfolio is a modern, fully responsive developer portfolio website built with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS and powered by Framer Motion for smooth animations.

Designed for developers who want to showcase their skills, projects, and professional experience in a visually appealing way — this portfolio delivers both performance and personality.

🌈 Attractive Design System: Gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism cards, SVG assets, and minimalist typography.
